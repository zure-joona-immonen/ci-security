Branch protections enforce rules that help maintain a stable, high-quality codebase. By restricting merges, preventing force pushes, and requiring pull-request reviews, you ensure that critical branches remain safe from accidental or malicious changes. In this lab, you’ll create GitHub branch protection rules for both `protected` branches and `release` branches, providing an extra layer of security and control over how updates are made.

You’ll configure settings such as requiring an approved pull request, blocking force pushes, and restricting deletions or updates. Testing these rules will help confirm your configurations and illustrate how to keep vital branches safe in a collaborative environment.

## Protect a branch

Normally you most likely would protect your `main` or `master` branch. To make the the rest of the exercises more fluent we try to protect all the branches that start with `protected`.

Make sure that all the branches under `protected` are protected with:

- Require pull request with approval and conversation resolution
- Restrict deletions
- Block force pushes

Then make a branch protection rules for `release` of the software with:

- Restrict updates
- Restrict deletions
- Block force updates

## Disclaimer

First push to a new branch is not considered as a change. Requiring pull-request will start

## Example solution

<details>
  <summary>Spoiler warning - solution</summary>
  
  ### Protect protected

1. Sign in into GitHub
1. Select Rules/Rulesets from the Settings
1. Create a new ruleset `Protect protected` with `include by pattern` with pattern `protected**/**/*`
1. Set the Enforcement status to Active
1. Required fields above.
1. Test by creating a branch `protected/test` and then trying to modify file in it and pushing again.

### Protect releases

1. Select Rules/Rulesets from the Settings
1. Create a new ruleset `Protect releases` with `include by pattern` with pattern `release/**/*`
1. Set the Enforcement status to Active
1. Required fields from above.
1. Test by creating a branch `release/test` and then trying to modify file in it and pushing again.
